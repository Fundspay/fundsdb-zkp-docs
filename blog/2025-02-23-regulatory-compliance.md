Regulatory audits require financial institutions to verify data, but sharing sensitive details **poses security risks**. **fundsdb-zkpengine** provides a **privacy-preserving compliance solution** using **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**.  

<!-- truncate -->

## **How It Works**  

- Allows businesses to prove compliance **without disclosing actual financial records**.  
- Works with **AML (Anti-Money Laundering) & KYC (Know Your Customer) frameworks**.  
- Helps institutions **meet regulatory standards while maintaining data confidentiality**.  

### **Regulatory Proof Example**  

```js
const { generateProof } = require('fundsdb-zkpengine');

const proof = generateProof({ report: "financial_summary", auditor: "authority_id" });
console.log(proof);
