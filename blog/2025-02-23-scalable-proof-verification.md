As financial applications grow, ensuring **efficient and scalable proof verification** is critical. **fundsdb-zkpengine** optimizes proof validation for **high-throughput systems**, making it ideal for **blockchain networks and DeFi platforms**.  

<!-- truncate -->

## **Key Benefits**  

✅ **Fast verification** for real-time transactions.  
✅ Supports **batch processing** for handling multiple proofs at once.  
✅ **Lightweight computation** to reduce processing costs.  

### **Optimized Verification Example**  

```js
const { verifyProof } = require('fundsdb-zkpengine');

const isValid = verifyProof(proof, { optimized: true });
console.log(`Proof valid: ${isValid}`);
